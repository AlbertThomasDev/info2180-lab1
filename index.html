        <h2>Albert Thomas</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate software developer from Jamaica. I am interested
	    in programming, web design, game development and web development. For my 
        hobbies, I like creating stuff like music, graphics and videos, and I 
        also love outside activities like running and playing sports.
	    Since I like creating stuff, web development peaked my interest. I am 
	    eager to learn new skills and concepts to aid in my creative development
        and being a web developer will help me do just that.</p>
